<h2> Mediterranean Lifestyle Can Help Lower Your Risk of Cancer, Early Death </h2>

<ul>
    <li>New research shows that individuals adhering to a “Mediterranean lifestyle” have 29% lower risk of all-cause
        mortality and 28% lower risk of cancer mortality compared to those who do not.</li>
    <li>The Mediterranean lifestyle includes a variety of factors including diet, eating habits, and rest.</li>
    <li>The study suggests that the health benefits can be replicated outside of the Mediterranean.</li>
</ul>

<p> The Mediterranean lifestyle — including factors like diet, eating habits, rest, and physical exercise — has
    consistently been touted for its myriad health benefitsTrusted Source, being both heart-healthy and protective
    against cancer. But can those benefits be replicated outside the unique geography of the Mediterranean region?

    New research says: yes.

    In a study published this week in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, researchers found that adherence to the Mediterranean
    lifestyle by middle-aged individuals living in the United Kingdom reduced all-cause and cancer-related mortality by
    29% and 28%, respectively.

    “This study adds to the literature that beyond diet, other components of the Mediterranean Lifestyle can play a
    combined and stronger role in the risk of mortality, cancer and cardiovascular disease, not only in Mediterranean
    countries but in non-Mediterranean,” Dr. Mercedes Sotos-Prieto, PhD, lead study author, Nutrition Epidemiologist at
    the University Autonomous of Madrid, Spain, and Adjunct Professor at Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health, told
    Healthline.</p>

<h3> CDC Researchers are Investigating Mysterious Tick-Borne Disease </h3>

<ul>
    <li>According to a new report from the CDC, a novel bacterium was found in 4 U.S. patients who were suspected of
        being infected with tick-borne illnesses. This is just an initial report and further research is needed.</li>
    <li>Antibiotics are the first line of treatment for these infections.</li>
    <li>For safety precautions, people are advised to avoid areas that are known to be tick-infested and wear
        appropriate clothing to minimize risk.</li>
</ul>
<p> The CDC recently announced the presence of novel Anaplasma bovis–like infections in humans. In the report in
    Emerging Infectious Diseases, health officials stated they found the A. bovis-like bacterium in 4 U.S. patients who
    are believed to have tick-borne diseases.

    The CDC points out that multiple Anaplasma species are already known to lead to tick-borne illness in humans.

    “Three recognized species (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma ovis, and Anaplasma bovis) and one provisionally
    named species (Anaplasma capra) are associated with moderately severe to severe disease in humans,” the CDC
    reported.

    Little is known about how disease symptoms may present or how common infections with the A. bovis-like agent are in
    the population.

    “The spectrum of disease and epidemiology associated with human infections caused by this novel A. bovis–like agent
    remains unknown. Presumably, human infections with this agent in the United States are uncommon, because this
    bacterium was detected only 4 times from 29,928 residual clinical samples,” the report noted.</p>

    <h4> How a Novel Vaccine for the Epstein-Barr Virus Could Reduce the Risk of MS, Cancer. </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Researchers announced a new study looking at a potential vaccine for the Epstein-Barr virus.</li>
        <li>The virus is one of the most common viruses around the world and is linked to certain cancers and an
            increased risk of multiple sclerosis.</li>
        <li> The latest study looked at how a potential vaccine worked to boost the immune system of mice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> We are one step closer to having a vaccine against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)Trusted Source, one of the most
        common human viruses that causes mononucleosis and long-term complications, including some cancers and multiple
        sclerosis (MS).

        Approximately 95% of the world population has contracted EBV, and while most people are asymptomatic or recover
        without any issues, the infection is thought to be a major risk factor for the development of MS, lymphoma, and
        nasopharyngeal cancer. </p>
